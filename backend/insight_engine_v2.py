"""
Dekho Insight Engine v2
========================
Fully offline, zero dependencies beyond Python stdlib.
Philosophy: Confusion → Awareness → Understanding → Habit → Confidence → Asset Creation

Key improvements over v1:
- 50+ spending patterns vs 10
- Multi-signal reasoning (combines patterns + emotion + time + history)
- User journey stage awareness (beginner → intermediate → confident)
- Seasonal / contextual awareness (salary day, month start/end, festivals)
- Streak & habit tracking language
- Per-category deep insights (not just "food is high")
- Variety engine with usage tracking (never repeats same variant twice in a row)
- "Tap to see why" detail explanations
- Ask Dekho Q&A responses
- Negative event handling (overspend, missed savings) with zero guilt
- Cross-signal storytelling ("three things happened this week...")
- Opportunity detection language
- Risk-aware investment language
